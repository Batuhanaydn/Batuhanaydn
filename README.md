<br />
<p>In my normal life, those who get along well with their family and friends do not prefer a life away from the computer and the internet. I am someone whose biggest social activity is playing and playing Fantastic Role Playing Games (FRP) like DnD, Fate, and Pathfinder. Leading people, and doing business in a group is one of my life goals. I am still proud of being the 2nd in the 2022 Elazig Hackathon organized by Vodafone recently. I am constantly working to improve myself every day and to make sure that every day I wake up is not wasted.</p>

<p>:muscle: I am currently ... I continue my 100DaysOfHacking project in order to continue my own path in a disciplined way and to be a roadmap for other people.</p>
<p>:eyes: I’m currently learning ... everything I need to filling my gaps to become a better cyber security specialist.</p>
<p>:speech_balloon: Ask me about anything related to... my content. I am happy to help.</p>
<p>:ghost: Fun fact: ... I'm currently studying computer engineering and I'm trying to push myself further every day. </p>
